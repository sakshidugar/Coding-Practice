HOW TO IMPLEMENT INFIX TO POSTFIX

>> Scan the infix expression from left to right. 
>> If the scanned character is an operand, output it. 
>> If the character is '(' then push it into the stack.
>> If the charater is ')' then pop each element from stack till we encounter ')'and {check if stack if not empty while poping for the search for '('}.
>> check if stack is not empty and then check if the precidance of the operator is greater(in stack) than chaacter read from infix string then pop all the character
   from stack whose precidance is less than string infix character.And then push the charater (x[i)).
>> now out of for loop
>> check if stack is empty or not, if stack is not empty then pop all elements and joing with the postfix string at end one by one.
